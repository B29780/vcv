IT Student Portfolio
Welcome to my IT student portfolio! I created this responsive web portfolio to showcase my technical skills and projects in a way that reflects my passion for technology and innovation. Every element was designed with intention—from the aesthetics to the performance.

Design and Implementation Overview
I built the design around a professional IT theme, using visual and interactive elements that reflect my interest in the digital world. Here's a breakdown of what I implemented:

Animated Digital Network Background: I used pure CSS to create a layered, animated background that simulates moving network nodes, circuit patterns, and binary code. It gives the site a futuristic and immersive feel.

Professional Color Scheme: I chose a modern palette of deep navy, slate blue, and cyan accents to maintain a clean and professional look.

Developer-Focused Typography: To keep with the tech theme, I used monospace fonts that resonate with coding and development environments.

Dynamic Profile Animation: Instead of using a basic spinning profile image, I went with a smooth, subtle floating effect for a more polished interaction.

Responsive Layout: I followed a mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox to make sure the layout works seamlessly on all screen sizes—from smartphones to desktops.

Performance Optimization: I kept all visual animations in pure CSS to ensure smooth, hardware-accelerated performance, without relying on JavaScript.

Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling Tools: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Custom Properties

Animations: CSS Keyframes, Transforms, and Transitions

Customization
I made the portfolio easy to edit and personalize:

Content: You can update all text sections (like About, Projects, Contact) directly inside the index.html file.

Assets: All images and files are in the assets/ folder. If you change a filename, just make sure to update the references in index.html.

Styling: All the main visual styles—including animations and color schemes—are in style.css. You can tweak these to make the design your own.
